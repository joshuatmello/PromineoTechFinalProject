# PromineoTechFinalProject

This project is called "Coffee Subscription Service" and it serves as my final project in the PromineoTech bootcamp!!

I LOVE coffee. There is actually local coffee roasting company that I really enjoy and they are very much a start-up, operate-out-of-their-garage type of business. They sell their product at the farmer’s market but do not have a website and have not expanded beyond the farmer’s market or local deliveries right now. My thought is that it would be fun to create and implement a RESTful Web API with full CRUD operations on a MySQL database that could ultimately be provided to this company in the long-term, and after I finish working through my “Stretch Goals”. Since they only sell whole bean or ground coffee of a variety of types, I thought it would be a good way to approach this project. For what it is worth, of course I bought some of their coffee to enjoy while I worked on this project!

In the future I think it would be good to add the following: 
-a way for collecting money
-an option for subscribing beyond the weekly subscription (i.e. a way to choose to subscribe for delivery every 2, 4, or 6 weeks). 
	 Subscription Table (On/Off; Boolean) on it’s own table with Duration (enum 2-4-6)
